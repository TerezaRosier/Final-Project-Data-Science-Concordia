Prediction of Breast Cancer-Related Genes/Proteins Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict genes and proteins associated with breast cancer using results from genetic testing. By leveraging a comprehensive database derived from DisGENet and Harmonizome, the focus is on critical genes such as PTEN, CHEK2, ATM, PIK3CA, and most importantly, BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53. These three genes are particularly significant in the context of prognosis, as they considerably increase the chances of developing cancer at a young age. The goal is to uncover patterns and correlations that can improve the accuracy of predictions related to various facets of breast cancer, thereby enhancing our understanding of the disease and improving detection methods and therapeutic approaches.
